About Printing Positive Numbers In a List.

Given a list of numbers, write a Python program to print all positive numbers in given list.

Example 1:
Input: list1 = [12, -7, 5, 64, -14]
Output: 12, 5, 64

Example 2:
Input: list2 = [12, 14, -95, 3]
Output: [12, 14, 3]

Example #1: Print all positive numbers from given list using for loop

Iterate each element in the list using for loop and check if number is greater than or equal to 0. If the condition satisfies, then only print the number.
